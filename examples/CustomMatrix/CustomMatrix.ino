/*
 * Many matrices have special properties which mean that they can be represented with less memory or that computations
 * that they are involved can be carried out much more efficiently. Sparse matrices for example might have enormous
 * dimensions but only a few non-zero elements. So in these kinds of matrices it's a waste to reserve a huge amount of
 * memory for a whole heap of zeros. Similarly, it's a waste to cycle through each of those zeros every time we want to
 * do a computation. Instead it'd be better to just store the non-zero elements and skip past the zeros when doing a
 * computation.
 *
 * For that reason, I've written the matrix class such that it's memory and the way it is accessed can be customised to
 * take advantage of whatever helpful properties the particular matrix might have. In this example we'll look at a
 * diagonal matrix - a matrix whose elements are zero except for those along it's diagonal (row == column)

// All the functions in BasicLinearAlgebra are wrapped up inside the namespace BLA, so specify that we're using it like
// so:
using namespace BLA;

void setup()
{
    Serial.begin(115200);

    // If you've been through the HowToUse example you'll know that you can allocate a Matrix and explicitly specify
    // it's type like so:
    BLA::Matrix<4, 4> mat;

    // And as before it's a good idea to fill the matrix before we use it
    mat.Fill(1);

    // Now let's declare a diagonal matrix. To do that we pass the Diagonal class from above along with whatever
    // template parameters as a template parameter to Matrix, like so:
    BLA::Matrix<4, 4, Diagonal<4, float>> diag;

    // If we fill diag we'll get a matrix with all 1's along the diagonal, the identity matrix.
    diag.Fill(1);

    // So multiplying it with mat will do nothing:
    Serial << "still ones: " << diag * mat << "\n";

    // Diagonal matrices have the handy property of scaling either the rows (premultiplication) or columns
    // (postmultiplication) of a matrix

    // So if we modify the diagonal
    for (int i = 0; i < diag.Rows; i++) diag.delegate(i, i) = i + 1;

    // And multiply again, we'll see that the rows have been scaled
    Serial << "scaled rows: " << diag * mat;

    // Point being, if you define a class which serves up something when called upon by the () operator, you can embed
    // it in a matrix and define any kind of behaviour you like. Hopefully that'll let this library support lots more
    // applications while catering to the arduino's limited amount of memory.
